# BacktrackingMazeGUI
This is a logical extension of a homework assignment (HW4) I did in the Advanced Java course at Bloomsburg University. It presents an input screen to ask the user to 
input a square maze (of dimension n by n) and outputs spaces corresponding to what type of space they are. If you are using Java 11 or later, be sure to configure the JavaFX
VM options for proper use. You should get an input text boxes and an output of square mazes.
